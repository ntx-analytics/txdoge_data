Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. Completed investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. Investigations may include more than one alleged victim. All allegations in a completed investigation are given one of the following dispositions Reason to Believe RTB - defined in section 2281.2 of the CPS policy handbook Ruled Out RO - defined in section 2281.3 of CPS policy handbook Unable to Complete UTC - defined in section 2281.4 of CPS policy handbook Unable to Determine UTD - defined in section 2281.4 of CPS policy handbook If at least one allegation has an RTB disposition, the investigation is given an overall disposition of RTB.

waxz-c9q5,CPI 3.1 Completed Abuse/Neglect Investigations by County and Region FY2015-FY2024,"Child Protective Investigations CPI is authorized to investigate abuse and neglect allegedly committed by a person responsible for a childs care, custody or welfare and to protect abused and neglected children from further harm. This authorization is derived from the U.S. Social Securities Act, Texas Family Code, Human Resources Code, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, Indian Child Welfare Act and the Adam Walsh Act. CPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response AR. Both require CPI to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child and assess the risk of future abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR, however, allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach on lower priority cases involving alleged victims who are age 6 or older. AR differs from traditional investigations in that there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety. Completed investigations only include those cases conducted as a traditional investigation that were not administratively closed or merged into another stage. An investigation can only be administratively closed if all allegations have a disposition of administrative closure. A completed investigation can include more than one alleged victim. Completed investigations do not include any Alternative Response cases. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation is in the glossary. FOOTNOTES An investigation represents a report of abuse or neglect and can involve multiple children. The data on completed investigations does not include investigative stages that were administratively closed or merged into another investigation. All completed investigations have a case disposition and a risk finding.

The APS specialist works with the client to develop a service plan to address identified problems. Safely maintaining clients in the least restrictive environment is a primary goal of APS intervention. Protective services may be necessary to alleviate or prevent the client from returning to a state of abuse, neglect or financial exploitation. In this case, DFPS may also provide services to a family member or caretaker. Texas Human Resources Code 48.002a5 and 48.204 Protective services may be delivered in every stage of an investigation The APS specialist makes all reasonable efforts to resolve problems, including root causes, and stabilizes the clients condition. Full resolution of a clients problems is always the goal of APS casework, but it is not always achievable. When full resolution is not a practical goal because of inadequate resources, client resistance, or some other impediment, the APS specialist closes the case when a clients situation is as close to stable as possible.

A subset of these reports are sent down the Alternative Response AR pathway. Those reports not sent to AR continue as a traditional investigation. CPI must initiate these investigations within 72 hours of receiving a Priority II report. In November 2014, CPI implemented Alternative Response AR which is a different way to respond to reports of abuseneglect. AR allows for a more flexible, family engaging approach while still focusing on the safety of the children. AR cases differ from traditional investigations cases in that there will be no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there will be a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains the safety.

AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. Alterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021. Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County. The persons in these counts are limited to principals in Alternative Response stages. Clients in stages that were administratively closed or closed to merge were excluded from the counts.

m5eg-ew8m,CPI 5.1 Alternative Response Stages FY2015-2024,"Child Protective Investigations CPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response AR. Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. Alterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021. Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County.

t8e4-4wcj,CPI 5.2 Alternative Response Stages - Timeliness of Initial Contact FY2015-2024,"ABOUT THIS CHART Child Protective Investigations CPI conducts either a traditional investigation or Alternative Response AR. Traditional investigations and Alternative Response require caseworkers to assess safety and take needed actions to protect a child while assessing any risk of abuse or neglect in the foreseeable future. AR cases present a less adversarial more collaborative approach to working with families by allowing for family engagement along with other community supports to ensure child safety. AR differs from traditional investigations in that AR cases are Priority 2 cases involving victims who are age 6 or older, there is no substantiation of allegations, no entry of perpetrators into the Central Registry a repository for reports of child abuse and neglect, and there is a heightened focus on guiding the family to plan for safety in a way that works for them and therefore sustains safety. Alternative response is timely if the first face-to-face meeting with the family and children in the household occurs within five days of an AR stage being opened and will involve working with the family to conduct safety and family assessments. AR cases can remain open for up to 60 days with a one-time 20-day extension, if appropriate. Should CPI staff identify services to improve general family functioning and overall protective actions within the standard AR case time frame, the caseworker will provide support in linking the family to existing resources within the community. A description of Alternative Response and how it differs from a traditional investigation and priority response times are in the glossary. Alterative Response has been fully implemented in Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. AR in Region 6A is in the implementation stage. Full state implementation is anticipated in March 2021. Region 6A is Harris County and Region 6B is Region 6 excluding Harris County.
